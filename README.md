## Assignment 2 Semester 2 2017

### Overview
This game is called 'Tower Defense Ultimate'. Below is an image detailing the basics of the
main game screen. Video can be seen here: https://youtu.be/rIf7a7ia7ac. Note the gameplay has been edited to try and
fit as many things as possible in to a short video. The enemy types in the first rounds are not usually as seen in the video, and you don't start with that much money.
